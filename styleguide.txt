This file aims at setting the groundwork for the general style of this repo:


 - Naming of vairiables and functions: As clear and comprehensible as possible: Main goal is fast understanding
    - abbreviations only when it is easily understandible what is abbreviated
    - similar functionalities should be named in a similar way (e.g. logging functionality same / identical names)

 - Error processing:
    - Error Reporting: Error messages should be thrown directly at the place of occurence
    - Each function should give an error messages: this error message is used for debugging/testing, as well as terminating the processing if severe errors occur

Spacing:
 - between two functions or two main functionalities 2 lines 
 - One line elsewehere to separate blocks for readability 
 - Comments do not count as lines
